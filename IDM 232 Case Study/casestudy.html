            <h2 id="over" >Overview </h2>
            
            <h4 class="bold" >This project was designed for my IDM 241 class at Drexel University. In the project I was assigned the task to create a dynamic recipe website that can perform CRUD operations and can also be viewed by the users. We did research on some PHP recipe websites we liked and deconstructed them to understand how does a databse function in a dynamic website. After the research I worked with PHP and MySQL to create my own recipe website that can show various recipes
            </h4>

            <h2 id="cont" >Context and Challenge </h2>
            <h4 class="bold" >As mentioned before, this project was done for my IDM 241 class and was supposed to be completed in a 10 week period of time. The languages and tools we used for the project were PHP,HTML, CSS, and MySQL. Ultimately, I wanted to use this class to design something that I could use in my portfolio as well. I had a lot of projects in my portfolio and wanted to do something that lets a user take a quick overview of my skills in backend management and proficiency with PHP and MySQL.

             <h2 id="prob" >The Problem</h2>
             <h4 class="doublebold"> The problem was the new language of PHP and MySQL. I had never worked on a database management software, I also did not have any experience with PHP. Other than having no experience in backend programming, debugging was the biggest and most time consuming problem as the errors often did not tell me the root cause and I had to manually get and scrutinize each line of code to find errors</h4>
                        
            
        

            <h2 id="go" >DESIGN GOALS </h2>
            <h4 class="bold"> My Goal was to create a dynamic PHP website that lets a User/Admin perform CRUD operations on any recipe on the website.
            </h4>

            <h2 id="met" >Tangible Goals & Metrics Used</h2>
            <h4 class="bold">The tangible goals were just to create a CRUD application and connecting it to a database. 
            </h4>

            <h2 id="pro" >Process & Insight</h2>
            <h4 class="bold"> I started my work by creating a Alpha Wireframes of the page. These included an Welcome Page, Category Page, View Recipe Page, and an Admin Panel to update or delete any recipe.
                Below is my Alpha Build.
            </h4>

            <h4 class="bold">Since I already had an idea of what I wanted to do from looking at examples from website above (look at image above). I spent time putting in thoughts on what my Beta would look like. I started from trying to gain an understanding of PHP and MySQL and created my Home Page for Beta. This home page basically served as an Admin Panel and had options to Create, Edit, and Delete and Recipe. I also added the functionality to add an image of the recipe.
                <br>
               Eventhough I added an option to upload a photo, I could not find a way to change the image of an already uploaded recipe. Below are picures of my progress of Beta Project

            <h2 id="fi" >Final Build:</h2>
            

            <h4 class="bold">After much more refinements and feedback I was able to come up with a final version of the Final Build of the Recipe Website. I also added a Home, Categories and Admin button on the right for quick access to these pages.  Below are more details and a link that shows the final build in action.
            </h4>

           

            <h2 id="ch" >PROJECT CHALLENGES:</h2>
            <h4 class="bold">Debugging was the biggest and most time consuming problem as the errors often did not tell me the root cause and I had to manually get and scrutinize each line of code to find errors. Due to my busy schedule I was also not able to make as many debugging appointments as I needed.

                <h2 id="re" >RESULTS</h2>
            <h4 class="bold">The results were not perfect but satisfying. I think the project was a success as I was able to create a PHP based Recipe website that allows an Admin to perform CRUD operations and look at the recipes  which were my direct goals of this project.
<br>
<br>
                Through my surveys I found 75% of the people liked Website and liked how it offered a short recipes with options to Create, Read, Update and Delete recipes.
          <br> 
          <br>     
                Even Though I could not work on uploading a new image I still learned a lot in this class through this project. I realized the importance of setting a realistic goal in the beginning and working on small elements of the a CRUD one by one. I also learned a lot about reusing code from already made examples and other websites and how to tailor it so it fits in my webpage.
      <br> 
      <br>         
                In the future, I would love to add an option to edit image and nice animations to every small element of the website I created.
